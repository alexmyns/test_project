- In the first case, with a normal distribution of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, we see that the range of time spent on the landing page is wider compared to the second case. This suggests that there is a greater variability in the time spent by visitors on the landing page. It could indicate that some visitors spend significantly more time, while others spend significantly less time.

1. Normal Distribution with Mean 10 and Standard Deviation 2:
    - This distribution has a wider spread compared to the second distribution (mean 10 and std 1).
    - The average time spent is the same for both distributions, which is 10.
    - The tails of the distribution extend further, indicating that there are some visitors who spend significantly more or less time on the landing page.
    - The distribution is relatively symmetrical around the mean, with a peak near the mean value of 10.

2. Normal Distribution with Mean 10 and Standard Deviation 1:
    - This distribution has a narrower spread compared to the first distribution (mean 10 and std 2).
    - The average time spent is the same for both distributions, which is 10.
    - The distribution has less variation, indicating that the majority of visitors spend time close to the mean value of 10.
    - The distribution is relatively symmetrical around the mean, with a sharp peak near the mean value of 10.
    - The landing page with the normal distribution having a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 1 performs better.

- This is because the distribution is narrower and indicates that visitors tend to spend time close to the average of 10.

- The narrower distribution suggests that the landing page has a more consistent user experience, with a majority of visitors spending time close to the average value.

- On the other hand, the wider distribution of the first landing page indicates more variability in the time spent, with some visitors spending significantly more or less time, potentially suggesting a less consistent user experience.

- However, it's important to note that drawing conclusions solely based on the graph can be limited. It's always advisable to complement such analysis with additional data and metrics to have a comprehensive understanding of landing page performance""")
